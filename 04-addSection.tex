\begin{abstract}
This document describes the use of latex for creating a document. The document is divided into various sections that describe
how to add and/or customize various parts of a document. For example, In order to add abstract, we create a new environment 
using \verb+ \begin{abstract} + and \verb+ \end{abstract} + and put the contents of the abstract inside the abstract environment.
\end{abstract}


\section{Adding Section}
To add a section just use \verb+\section +

\subsection{Adding Subsection}
The command to add a subsection is very similar to that of section. The only difference being instead of 
section we write subsection \verb+\subsection +

\subsubsection{Adding Sub Subsection}
The above method can be further extended to add sub subsection.
