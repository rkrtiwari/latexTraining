The authors of the CTAN team listed ten good reasons
for using \TeX. Among them are:
\begin{quotation}
    \TeX\ has the best output. What you end with,
    the symbols on the page, is as useable, and beautiful,
    as a non-professional can produce.

    \TeX\ knows typesetting. As those plain text samples
    show, \TeX's has more sophisticated typographical algorithms
    such as those for making paragraphs and for hyphenating.

    \TeX\ is fast. On today's machines \TeX\ is very fast.
    It is easy on memory and disk space, too. 

    \TeX\ is stable. It is in wide use, with a long history.
    It has been tested by millions of users, on demanding input.
    It will never eat your document. Never.
